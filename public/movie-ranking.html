<h3>Baahubali : The Beginning</h3>
<p>This an epic film which was directed by the legendary director S S Rajamouli. Starring Rebel Star Prabhas as the protagonist playing the role as Mahendra Baahubali as well as Amarendra Baahubali. This movie showcases how an elder brother of an actually capable king is ready to even betray and kill his own mother to get the throne in the greed for power. So sit back and enjoy the show to the fullest.
